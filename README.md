BYU Script test

Assumptions:
1) Your machine can run python version 3.7 and has the following modules available for import:
      - json
      - requests
      - getpass
      - base64
      - os
2) I assumed that creating a session was preffered for the project rather than using a curl commnad for everything. 
2) You already have an existing GitHub account
3) Your GitHub account is already a member of an organization on GitHub
4) The Repositories in the github organization that you are checking already have a branch created for you to add the license file to and create the pull request from.
5) I assumed that the idea was to involve the user so they had a cusomized experience, the program asks for the login, organization, branch, and type of license for that repository.

In order to run the code: 
1) 
1) Open terminal or command prompt on a machien with python3 and then run python3
